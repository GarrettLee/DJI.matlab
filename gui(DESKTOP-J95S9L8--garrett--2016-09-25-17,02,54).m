function varargout = gui(varargin)
%GUI M-file for gui.fig
%      GUI, by itself, creates a new GUI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = GUI returns the handle to a new GUI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      GUI('Property','Value',...) creates a new GUI using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to gui_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      GUI('CALLBACK') and GUI('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in GUI.M with the given input
%      arguments.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
